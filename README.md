# active-learning


In this repo we try to achieve the best accuracy we can on CIFAR-10 by training only on a subset of the CIFAR-10 dataset. The subset on which we train will be hand-picked using active learning strtegies. 


The performance of the active learning strategies is evaluated against a reference accuracy achieved by training the same model in a pure supervised fashion on the entire CIFAR-10 dataset.
